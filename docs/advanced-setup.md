# Advanced setup

## Environments

You can customize the environment before first run changing the environments.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the values of `.env`

`VERSION_NEXTCLOUD` To this environment I recommend to use the branch `master`. If you need to work with old version of server, use other branch of [Nextcloud server repository](https://github.com/nextcloud/server).

## PHP custom settings

If you need custom settings in PHP, change the file [`.docker/app/config/php.ini`](/.docker/app/config/php.ini).
